# NFT-Minter

## Project Introduction
(This is a course project of ELEN 6883 Introduction to Blockchain)

In this project, we created a DAPP for minting NFT, here we can mint static NFT and dynamic NFT.

For the static NFT, we design the layers and generate the NFT randomly.

For the dynamic NFT, we use the design from Geek-Brew http://www.xinhuang.info/Geek-Brew.html, the design of Sichuan Opera Play is a colaboration with Meishan Sansu Museum.

## Functions 
There are several functions we create to build up this full-stack blockchain project, the basic one is to get info of the account, by using that, we can display the current balance of account.

Other functions are related to NFT minting, such as the confirmation of transaction, the call of NFT, etc.
