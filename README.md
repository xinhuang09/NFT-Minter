## Project Overview
In this project, we've created a full-stack DAPP for users to mint static and dynamic NFTs.

We program a full-stack blockchain DAPP mainly focusing on NFT minting, we use solidity to program the smart contract as the core of the backend and JS for the web development of the frontend, also we discuss a new encryption approach for Gifs and Video, which is inspired by the concept of Merkle Tree. By combining those techniques, we bring an DAPP with a core functionality of NFT minting and several novelties.

## Instructions
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
